# GDScript Mod Loader

A general purpose mod-loader for GDScript-based Godot Games.

For detailed info, see the [docs for Delta-V Modding](https://gitlab.com/Delta-V-Modding/Mods/-/blob/main/MODDING.md), upon which ModLoader is based. The docs there cover mod setup and helper functions in much greater detail.

## Mod Setup

### Structure

Mod ZIPs should have the structure shown below. The name of the ZIP is arbitrary.

```
yourmod.zip
â”œâ”€â”€â”€.import
â””â”€â”€â”€mods-unpacked
    â””â”€â”€â”€Author-ModName
        â”œâ”€â”€â”€mod_main.gd
        â””â”€â”€â”€manifest.json
```

#### Notes on .import

Adding the .import directory is only needed when your mod adds content such as PNGs and sound files. In these cases, your mod's .import folder should **only** include your custom assets, and should not include any vanilla files.

You can copy your custom assets from your project's .import directory. They can be easily identified by sorting by date. To clean up unused files, it's helpful to delete everything in .import that's not vanilla, then run the game again, which will re-create only the files that are actually used.


### Required Files

Mods you create must have the following 2 files:

- **mod_main.gd** - The init file for your mod.
- **manifest.json** - Meta data for your mod (see below).

#### Example manifest.json

```json
{
	"name": "ModName",
	"namespace": "AuthorName",
	"version_number": "1.0.0",
	"description": "Mod description goes here",
	"website_url": "https://github.com/example/repo",
	"dependencies": [
		"Add IDs of other mods here, if your mod needs them to work"
	],
	"extra": {
		"godot": {
			"id": "AuthorName-ModName",
			"incompatibilities": [
				"Add IDs of other mods here, if your mod conflicts with them"
			],
			"authors": ["AuthorName"],
			"compatible_modloader_version": "3.0.0",
			"compatible_game_version": ["0.6.1.6"],
			"config_defaults": {}
		}
	}
}
```

See `get_mod_config` below for info on `config_defaults`.



## Helper Methods

Use these when creating your mods. As above, see the [docs for Delta-V Modding](https://gitlab.com/Delta-V-Modding/Mods/-/blob/main/MODDING.md) for more details.

### mod_log

	func mod_log(text:String, mod_name:String = "Unknown-Mod", pretty:bool = false)->void

Log data to *godot.log.*. The mod ID should be provided as the 2nd arg.

### dev_log

	func dev_log(text:String, mod_name:String = "Unknown-Mod", pretty:bool = false)

Logs verbose info to *godot.log*, but only if developer logging is enabled, either via the CLI arg `--log-dev` or by temporarily changing the `DEBUG_ENABLE_DEV_LOG` to `true`.

### install_script_extension

	func install_script_extension(child_script_path:String)

Add a script that extends a vanilla script. `child_script_path` is the path to your mod's extender script path, eg `MOD/extensions/singletons/utils.gd`.

Inside that extender script, it should include `extends "{target}"`, where `{target}` is the vanilla path, eg: `extends "res://singletons/utils.gd"`.

Your extender scripts don't have to follow the same directory path as the vanilla file, but it's good practice to do so.

One approach to organising your extender scripts is to put them in a dedicated folder named "extensions", eg:

```
yourmod.zip
â”œâ”€â”€â”€.import
â””â”€â”€â”€mods-unpacked
    â””â”€â”€â”€Author-ModName
        â”œâ”€â”€â”€mod_main.gd
        â”œâ”€â”€â”€manifest.json
        â””â”€â”€â”€extensions
            â””â”€â”€â”€Any files that extend vanilla code can go here, eg:
            â”œâ”€â”€â”€main.gd
            â””â”€â”€â”€singletons
                â”œâ”€â”€â”€item_service.gd
                â””â”€â”€â”€debug_service.gd
```

### add_translation_from_resource

	add_translation_from_resource(resource_path: String)

Add a translation file, eg "mytranslation.en.translation". The translation file should have been created in Godot already: When you import a CSV, such a file will be created for you.

Note that this function is exclusive to ModLoader, and departs from Delta-V's two functions [addTranslationsFromCSV](https://gitlab.com/Delta-V-Modding/Mods/-/blob/main/MODDING.md#addtranslationsfromcsv) and [addTranslationsFromJSON](https://gitlab.com/Delta-V-Modding/Mods/-/blob/main/MODDING.md#addtranslationsfromjson), which aren't available in ModLoader.

### append_node_in_scene

	append_node_in_scene(modified_scene, node_name:String = "", node_parent = null, instance_path:String = "", is_visible:bool = true)

Create and add a node to a instanced scene.

### save_scene

	save_scene(modified_scene, scenePath:String)

Save the scene as a PackedScene, overwriting Godot's cache if needed.

### get_mod_config

	get_mod_config(mod_id:String = "", key:String = "", default_value = null)->Dictionary:

Get data from a mod's config JSON file. Returns a dictionary with three keys: `data`, `error`, and `error_msg`, which are explained below.

#### Data

Data (`data`) is either the full config, or data from a specific key if one was specified.

If no user config JSON exists, `data` uses the defaults set in the mod's *manifest.json* (see [Config JSON](#config-json) below). Returns an empty dictionary (`{}`) if either a) the mod's *manifest.json* has no defaults, or b) the specified `key` doesn't exist.

#### Error

Error (`error`) is `0` if there were no errors, or `> 0` if the setting could not be retrieved:

| #   | Description | Data |
| --- | ----------- | ---- |
| `0` | No errors   | *As requested* |
| `1` | Invalid `mod_id` | `{}` |
| `2` | No custom JSON exists | Defaults from *manifest.json* |
| `3` | Invalid `key`. Custom JSON does not exist | `{}` |
| `4` | Invalid `key`. Custom JSON *does* exist | `{}` |

#### Error Msg

Text representation of the error that occured, intended to make debugging easier.



## Config JSON

ModLoader supports config files in the JSON format. Custom configs can be added by users, to a folder named *configs* (`res://configs`). They are named by the mod ID (eg. `AuthorName-ModName.json`).

### Defaults

Default settings can be set in your *manifest.json* file, via `extra.godot.config_defaults`.

If you use `get_mod_config` when no custom JSON file exists, your mod's default settings will be used instead (returned as `data`). This works wheter you're using `key` or not.

### Config Options

A user's custom config file can use a special setting, `load_from`. If specified, their config is loaded from the specified file, instead of the file named after the mod ID.

The `load_from` JSON file should be in the same directory, and include the file extension, eg:

```json
{
	"load_from": "my-special-config.json"
}
```

This allows users to multiple config files for a single mod and switch between them quickly. This settings is ignord if the filename matches the mod ID, or is empty.



## CLI Args

ModLoader supports the following command line arguments:

| Arg | Info |
| --- | ---- |
| `--mods-path`    | Override the path to the mod ZIPs dir. Default path is `res://mods` |
| `--configs-path` | Override the path to the config JSONs dir. Default path is `res://configs` |
| `--log-dev`      | Enable developer logging. This is more verbose and can be used with the func `dev_log`. |

You can use these in the Godot editor via *Project > Project Settings > Display > Editor > Main Run Args*
